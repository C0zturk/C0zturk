Hi, my name is Cag but you can call me C0z.  I am cyber security engineer with interests in Pen Testing, Programming & Network Security.  This is where I document my personal endeavours related to offsec.

Programming - Actively Learning Python & C#.  I enjoy automation/programming and I believe upskilling in this will make me a better sec engineer.
